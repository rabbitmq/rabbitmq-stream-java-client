The RabbitMQ Stream Java Client is a Java library to communicate with
the https://rabbitmq.com/stream.html[RabbitMQ Stream Plugin].
It allows to create and delete streams, as well as to publish to and consume from
these streams.

The client ships also with a
https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-stream-java-client/stable/htmlsingle/#the-performance-tool[performance tool].

Please refer to the https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-stream-java-client/stable/htmlsingle/[documentation]
(https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-stream-java-client/stable/pdf/index.pdf[PDF])
to find out more.

== Project Maturity

The project is in development and stabilization phase.
Features and API are subject to change, but https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-stream-java-client/stable/htmlsingle/#stability-of-programming-interfaces[breaking changes] will be kept to a minimum.

== Support

* For questions: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rabbitmq-users[RabbitMQ Users]
* For bugs and feature requests: https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-stream-java-client/issues[GitHub Issues]

== How to Use

=== Pre-requisites

The library requires Java 8 or later. Java 11 is recommended.

=== Documentation

==== Release

* https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-stream-java-client/stable/htmlsingle/[Reference documentation]
* https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-stream-java-client/stable/api/com/rabbitmq/stream/package-summary.html[API documentation]

==== Snapshot

* https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-stream-java-client/snapshot/htmlsingle/[Reference documentation]
* https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-stream-java-client/snapshot/api/com/rabbitmq/stream/package-summary.html[API documentation]

== Versioning

The RabbitMQ Stream Java Client is in development and stabilization phase.
When the stabilization phase ends, a 1.0.0 version will be cut, and
https://semver.org/[semantic versioning] is likely to be enforced.

Before reaching the stable phase, the client will use a versioning scheme of `[0.MINOR.PATCH]` where:

* `0` indicates the project is still in a stabilization phase.
* `MINOR` is a 0-based number incrementing with each new release cycle. It generally reflects significant changes like new features and potentially some programming interfaces changes.
* `PATCH` is a 0-based number incrementing with each service release, that is bux fixes.

Breaking changes between releases can happen but will be kept to a minimum.

== Build Instructions

You need JDK 8 or later installed.

To build the JAR file:

----
./mvnw clean package -DskipITs -DskipTests
----

To build the https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-stream-java-client/stable/htmlsingle/#the-performance-tool[Stream PerfTest] JAR:

----
./mvnw clean package -Dmaven.test.skip -P performance-tool
----

To run the performance tool from the created binary:

----
java -jar target/stream-perf-test.jar
----

=== Running Tests with Docker
